# My Own Kafka Template

My very naive  template for Kafka application.

## How to use it

* Clone the repository [KafkaTemplate](https://github.com/SaboiaEric/KafkaTemplate)
* Go to the `.\KafkaTemplate` folder and run `docker-compose up -d`
* To run the bow console application simultaneously: click right-click the solution in Solution Explorer and choose "Properties". In the properties window, select "Startup Project" and then "Multiple Startup Projects". Set the action for each project you want to start (e.g. "Start") and apply the settings.
